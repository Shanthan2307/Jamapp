# Setting Up a Virtual Environment in PowerShell  

To create a virtual environment in PowerShell, open PowerShell or Windows Terminal and navigate to your project directory using 
`cd path\to\your\project`.

Then, create and activate the virtual environment with 
`python -m venv venv; .\venv\Scripts\Activate`.

Once activated, 
`(venv)`

should appear in the PowerShell prompt. If your project has dependencies, install them using
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

When you're done, deactivate the virtual environment by running `deactivate`. Now you're ready to start coding! ðŸš€
